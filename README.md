# Loan_Prediction
This Model uses Supervised Learning Algorithm the dataset is avavilable on kaggle and I am attaching it here too.
There are total of 13 Columns 
I have cleaned the dataset as well as filled the missing values with mean and mode values
In this I have used 3 different algorithms Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest Regressor
The best result achieved is through Naive Bayes with an accuracy of about 83%
We can use other different Supervised Learning Algorithms such as linear regressor, Logical Regrssor, KNN etc
The training data is split into 2 parts X_train is 70% and X_test is 30%
